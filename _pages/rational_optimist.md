### What is special about humans?

- It’s not huge brains, complex languages, lots of technology — Neanderthals had three.
- Appearance of new technologies and people is explained by
    - Climate: Volatility in climate placed a premium on adaptability — why did it produce other technologically advanced apes or other African species
    - Genetic mutation: triggered a change in human behavior by subtly altering the way human brains were built — recent studies suggest Neanderthals share the same mutations meaning the modern people and Neanderthals maybe using sophisticated language
- The answer lies not in climate, nor genetics, nor in archaeology, nor even entirely in culture, but in economics.
- They had started, for the first time, to exchange things between unrelated, unmarried individuals; to share, swap, barter, or trade. The effect of this was to cause specialization, which in turn caused technological progress, which in turn encouraged more specialization, which led to more exchange - and “progress” was born, that meant technology and habits changing faster than anatomy.
- The big difference in every other species, the colonies of close relatives - even a city of million ants is really just a family.
- Exchange is to technology as sex is to evolution. It stimulates novelty.
- Human history is driven by a co-evolution of rules and tools. The increasing specialization of the human species, and the enlarging habit of exchange are the root cause of innovation in both.

### Why did humans acquire a taste for barter as other animals did not?

- Perhaps it has something to do with cooking. Beyond making it safe to live on ground, beyond liberating human ancestors to grow big brains on high-energy diets, cooking also predisposed humans to swapping different kinds of food.
- Fire is hard to start, but easy to share; likewise cooking food is hard to make but easy to share. The time spend cooking is subtracted from time spent chewing.
- An evolutionary bargain seems to have been struck: in exchange for sexual exclusivity, the man brings meat and protects from the fire of thieves and bullies; in exchange for help rearing the children, the women brings veg and does much of the cooking. This may be the reason humans are the only great apes with long pair bonds.

### Interesting Facts / Points:

- Creative Destruction, as Schumpeter called it, meant that there is as much creation going as destruction — that the growth of digital photography would create as many jobs as analogue, or just that the saving pocketed by a Walmart customer are soon spent on other things, leading to the opening of new stores to service those demands. In America, roughly 15% jobs are destroyed every year; and roughly 15% created.
- The size of the average American company is down from 25 to 10 in just 25 years. Tomorrow’s self-employed workers clocking on to work online in bursts for different clients when and where it suits them, will surely look back on the days of bosses and foremen, of meetings and appraisals, of time sheets and trade unions, with amusement. Firms are temporary aggregations of people to help them do their producing in such a way to help other do their consuming.
- A countries economic freedom predicts the prosperity better than its mineral wealth, education system, or infrastructure do. In a sample of 127 countries, the 63 with higher economic freedom had more than 4 times the income per capita and nearly twice the growth rate of countries that did not.
