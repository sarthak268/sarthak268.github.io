- Timeline: 
    - 14 billion years ago: Big Bang created space, time, and energy
    - 12-13 billion years ago to present: no fundamentally new astronomical objects have emerged
    - Hundreds of thousands years ago: people arose -- the antithesis of the universe's bland monotony
- Memes: (like genes) units of cultural transmission -- ideas, behaviors, and traditions that spread from person to person. Dawkins: what makes a meme die out isn't its benefit to its holders or society as a whole, it's the successful variant changes the behaviors of its holder in a way that makes it more likely to be passed on to others than its rivals.
- Static societies: e.g. 5 century BC Sparta of Ancient Greece 
    - Individuals who "offered" alternative memes punished or killed
    - Disable source of new ideas -- human creativity -- exploit childen's psychology to entrench themselves in their minds
- Dynamic societis: e.g. Athens during the "Golden Age" or "Age of Pericles" -- Plato and Aristotle 
    - Idea of Platonism and Idealism, and ideas about learning by studying and interacting emerged
    - Memes survived by criticism
