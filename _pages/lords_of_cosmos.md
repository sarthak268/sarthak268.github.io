- Timeline: 
    - 14 billion years ago: Big Bang created space, time, and energy
    - 12-13 billion years ago to present: no fundamentally new astronomical objects have emerged
    - Hundreds of thousands years ago: people arose -- the antithesis of the universe's bland monotony
- Memes: (like genes) units of cultural transmission -- ideas, behaviors, and traditions that spread from person to person. Dawkins: what makes a meme die out isn't its benefit to its holders or society as a whole, it's the successful variant changes the behaviors of its holder in a way that makes it more likely to be passed on to others than its rivals.
- Static societies: e.g. 5 century BC Sparta of Ancient Greece 
    - Individuals who "offered" alternative memes punished or killed
    - Disable source of new ideas -- human creativity -- exploit childen's psychology to entrench themselves in their minds
- Dynamic societis: e.g. Athens during the "Golden Age" or "Age of Pericles" -- Plato and Aristotle 
    - Idea of Platonism and Idealism, and ideas about learning by studying and interacting emerged
    - Memes survived by criticism
- Enemies of Civilization:
    - Socialism: advocates centralized institutions to take means of production away from citizens, believe weath is fixed pie.
    - Environmentalism (or degrowth movement): advocates that humanity minimize its impact on the environment by having fewer children, consuming less energy, and releasing less carbon into the atmosphere
    -   Scientism: false idea that scientific knowledge trumps all other kinds of knowledge, that science can give us answers to all our questions
    -   Relativism: the idea that there is no difference between right and wrong, good and evil
    -   Dogmatism: idea that is considered, implicitly, or explicitly uncriticizable, the final truth, known with certainity, never to be changed
    -   Doomererism: idea that humanity has no shot at continuing to make progress, or that our extinction is just around the corner, we are just one innovation away from guaranteeing our decline
- Transformation that Nature allow for (including star becoming a black hole, heilum atoms fusing to become carbon and iron inside the star, particles or antiparticles colliding and producing high energy photons) << Transformation that life can cause (human genome alone can cause hundred thousand different proteins)
- Humans are the only species that can bring about any transformation that is allowed by the laws of physics. If there were a thing that we can't achieve no matter what knowledge we bring to bear, then there is another (testable) law of physics that says we can't do that.
