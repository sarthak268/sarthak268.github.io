Elon Musk (02:35:38):

Well, I mean, the reason I guess I care about us becoming a multi-planet species in a space-faring civilization is, foundationally, I love humanity. And so I wish to see it prosper and do great things and be happy, and if I did not love humanity, I would not care about these things.

Lex Fridman (02:36:03):

So when you look at the whole of it, the human history, all the people who’s ever lived, all the people alive now, it’s pretty, we’re okay. On the whole, we’re a pretty interesting bunch.

Elon Musk (02:36:18):

All things considered, and I’ve read a lot of history, including the darkest, worst parts of it, and despite all that, I think, on balance, I still love humanity.

Lex Fridman (02:36:30):

You joked about it with the 42. What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing? Is there a non-numerical representation?

Elon Musk (02:36:39):

Yeah, really, I think what Douglas Adams was saying in Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy is that the universe is the answer, and what we really need to figure out are what questions to ask about the answer that is the universe, and that the question is really the hard part, and if you can properly frame the question, then the answer, relatively speaking, is easy. So therefore, if you want to understand what questions to ask about the universe, you want to understand the meaning of life, we need to expand the scope and scale of consciousness so that we’re better able to understand the nature of the universe and understand the meaning of life.

Lex Fridman (02:37:24):

And ultimately, the most important part would be to ask the right question. Yes. Thereby elevating the role of the interviewer. Yes, exactly. As the most important human in the room.

Elon Musk (02:37:38):

Good questions are, it’s hard to come up with good questions. Absolutely. But yeah, it’s like that is the foundation of my philosophy is that I am curious about the nature of the universe, and obviously I will die, I don’t know when I’ll die, but I won’t live forever. But I would like to know that we’re on a path to understanding the nature of the universe and the meaning of life and what questions to ask about the answer that is the universe. And so if we expand the scope and scale of humanity and consciousness in general, which includes silicon consciousness, then that seems like a fundamentally good thing.

Lex Fridman (02:38:27):

Elon, like I said, I’m deeply grateful that you would spend your extremely valuable time with me today and also that you have given millions of people hope in this difficult time, this divisive time, and this cynical time. So I hope you do continue doing what you’re doing. Thank you so much for talking.

Elon Musk (02:38:46):

All right, you’re welcome. Thanks for your excellent questions.
