*Genes are the puppet masters, we are their survival machines — my favorite biology book 🧬*

- Natural selection chooses genes — they are the fundamental unit of information that persists across generations.
- The only thing that truly passes from parent to offspring is digital information encoded in DNA. What survives the filter of time is not bodies, not species, but this digital code.
- Some genes survive better than others, and we — the animals, the plants, the bodies — are merely the machines built to preserve the genes that ride inside us.
- The goal of a gene is not to make its species superior to other species, nor to make its host organism superior to others of the same kind. The goal is simply to replicate and spread as widely as possible.
- A gene does not compete with other species — it competes with its rival alleles, alternative versions of itself, for a place on the chromosome. That is the selfish gene.
