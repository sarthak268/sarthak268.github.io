**Before Your First Move**

- Most people don’t think more than one or two moves ahead. Those people are amateurs and flame out quickly in business. Effective strategy is about making a move and being prepared to launch another series of moves based on how the market or your competition reacts. You must think beyond your first strike to execute an effective strategy. When you start to get really good, you anticipate how others will react and can deploy a series of moves that are nearly impossible to counteract.

**Move 1: Master Knowing Yourself**

- If you’re a visionary, blow up a picture of Walt Disney or Steve Jobs and put it in a prominent place. Have a little fun with it. If looking at Walt Disney doesn’t inspire you, keep a picture of Mickey Mouse or a stuffed Mickey in your office. If you’re building an e- commerce company, ask, “What would Jeff Bezos do?” If you’re running an investment firm, ask, “What would Warren Buffett do?” If you’re running a media company, ask, “What would Oprah Winfrey do?” Our heroes inspire us. That’s why it’s so powerful to surround yourself with them. The more we see them and the more we see them looking at us, the greater our chances of acting heroically.
- The most dangerous unhappy people I’ve met are those who are both extremely ambitious and extremely lazy. What this combination produces is envy, which is a deadly sin that will make your life a living hell. These are people who think big and want to do something big, but they’re not willing to put in the work to earn it. They’ll cheat. They’ll throw you under the bus. They’re constantly looking for shortcuts. And if someone else has what they want, it eats away at their very soul.
- If someone is winning at a higher level than you are, either lower your expectations to match your work ethic or increase your work ethic to exceed your expectations. If you do neither, you’ll be miserable.
- You need to understand who you are, what makes you tick, how much risk you can handle, and what type of family you want to create. The key element behind all the stories and exercises in this Move is honesty. Looking in the mirror can be painful at times. I shared with you how much I cried when I took the Personal Identity Audit. The pain was worth it. Once you become clear about the most important product (you), your decisions will flow naturally and lead you to accomplish your goals.
- You want to choose a path that puts the odds of winning in your favor; in poker, it’s called game selection. What determines if you win in any game (or business) isn’t how good you are; it’s how good you are relative to your competition. That’s why it’s so important to know your own strengths and weaknesses and find a market in which you have an inherent advantage.
- One thing I can tell you with certainty is that becoming an entrepreneur cannot be about the money. I know that sounds odd to say when you’re focused on becoming a millionaire or billionaire. If your motivation is only money, you’ll stop at some point. You’ll become lazy or complacent. If you want to be an entrepreneur, your reason has to go beyond wealth. The pain of owning a business is too great to tolerate just for money.
- Blue Ocean Strategy: How to Create Uncontested Market Space and Make the Competition Irrelevant by W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne, professors at INSEAD in Fontainebleau, France, was published in 2004. This book was the key resource that led me to find a game in which I could win. The premise of the book is that rather than competing in games where you’re an underdog, find unexplored new markets in which you can win— and ultimately make the competition irrelevant.

**Move 2: Master the Ability to Reason**

- You’re going to have moments when you feel as though the world is coming to an end. An amateur panics, but a grand master doesn’t. Before he does anything, he must first “process” what’s happening. He has to do so while staying on an even keel. This is why stoicism is both so important and so challenging— and why Marcus Aurelius and Seneca are sages who have stood the test of time. Emotion can get the best of all of us and cloud our judgment. Sadly, I’ve learned this lesson the hard way too many times. It’s why my answer about the key to success for people at all levels of business is “Know how to process issues.” Life is always happening; the way you respond is based on how you process issues.
- Building a business requires you to slay many dragons. Problems are inevitable; you’d better get a grip on solving them. To do so, you must be processing issues constantly. 
    1. Processing is the ability to make effective decisions based on access to information at hand with the highest odds in your favor. 
    2. Processing is about subjecting every difficult choice, problem, or opportunity you face to a rigorous mental analysis. 
    3. Processing is playing out strategies, seeing the hidden consequences, and sequencing a series of moves to permanently solve problems.
- Great processors use the word “I” and see their role in whatever problem has occurred. They ask questions such as “How did I contribute to this? What did I do to cocreate this situation? How can I improve so I’ll be better equipped to handle something like this in the future?” Poor processors play the victim and blame others and external events rather than seeing how they contributed to the problem. You know you’re witnessing a poor processor when you don’t hear the word “I.” You’ll hear him or her say things such as “All millennials are lazy. These kids have no work ethic. They are causing my business to suffer.” Expert processors replace the word “they” (or “you” or “it”) with the word “I.”
- What differentiates mediocre people from exceptional ones is how deeply they process. Most people are surface- level processors, but the best of the best go much deeper. Long- term thinking versus short- term thinking is the difference between a grand master and an amateur. Surface-level processors are looking for a quick fix. They are thinking only one move ahead, and their goal is to make the issue disappear for now. Deep-level processors look beneath the surface for causes. They are thinking several moves ahead and planning a sequence of moves to make sure the issue doesn’t happen again.
- Three Approaches to Dealing with an Issue 
    1. Find someone to blame. It’s much easier to externalize the problem than deal with it. If you can’t identify one person, email all your contacts, telling them to go to hell, followed by a row of middle- finger emojis. 
    2. Find a safe space to which to escape. Find a distraction. Check Instagram. Turn on the news, ESPN, or TMZ. Pretend you can multitask by clearing out your inbox. Better yet, call it a day and go home to your warm bed. 
    3. Find a way to process by taking responsibility. Take a deep breath and remind yourself that these are the moments that separate winners from losers.
- Processing Steps to Take When Someone Ticks You Off 
    1. Take responsibility for your role in what happened. 
    2. State specifically what you did to create the problem. 
    3. Channel your frustration into getting better and preventing future problems.
- Instead of blaming external events, you have to shift to seeing yourself as both the creator and the solver of issues. This is hardly a “soft” skill, and it’s one that I can’t emphasize enough. I also can’t emphasize enough that expert processors possess both emotional and analytical tools.
- The people I know who are expert processors have very different personalities and business strategies, but they share the following eight traits: 
    1. They ask lots of questions. Having more data leads to making better assumptions. What caused this? How can we solve it? How can we prevent it from happening again? 
    2. They don’t care about being right or wrong. They’re interested only in the truth. Great processors want to handle the situation and move on. If someone else has a better idea, great. Ego doesn’t become an obstacle to making the right decision. 
    3. They don’t make excuses. Wasting time and effort on why things went wrong isn’t their style. 
    4. They like to be challenged. Their priority is handling a situation quickly and effectively, and if other people have a solution— even if it differs from their own— they want to hear it. They relish people who cause them to consider alternatives or defend their position. 
    5. They’re curious. You can’t solve problems without knowledge. Processors are always learning more about their business and how it works. They love critical details as much as big ideas. 
    6. They prevent more problems than they solve. People who are really good at processing issues are also really good at spotting yellow flags before they turn red. 
    7. They make great negotiators. Curious problem solvers use logic to find a win for all parties involved. 8. They’re more interested in permanently solving a problem than putting a Band- Aid on it.
- Once a month, get together in a room with your leadership team— or simply a group of three to five trusted, open- minded peers— and spend an hour focused on the next big problem to solve. What I do in these meetings is bring up issues and let the team have a collaborative debate on the topic. The stronger the debate, the closer we get to the best decision. Listen instead of argue. Remain curious.
- Actually, only two kinds of events will require you to make decisions: 
    1. Offense. The opportunity to make money or advance your business or career. The choices here often revolve around growth, expansion, marketing, and sales. 
    2. Defense. The opportunity to solve a problem, to stop losing money, or to stop moving backward in some way. The choices here frequently involve legal matters such as compliance and protection against competitors or market corrections. <br>
    Once the problem or opportunity you’re facing can be categorized as offense or defense, it immediately becomes less intimidating. You’ve labeled it, and whether it’s offense or defense, you’ve dealt with both types of issues in the past. Decision making then goes from something scary and unfamiliar to something manageable.
