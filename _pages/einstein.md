<i>Existance of Atoms: Brownian Motion</i>

Larger particles are surrounded by many tiny molecules bouncing off of them. Since the liquid around them is composed of molecules all moving in various directions, on average the molecule collisions from one side of the large particles would most likely be balanced out by the collisions from the molecules on the other side. 

<i>Particle Nature of Atoms: Blackbody Radiations and Photoelectric Effect</i>

Objects give off light when heated -- think of an iron bar in the blacksmith's furnance. Now, suppose we heat up an empty metal sphere. The light emitted from the interior surface would be trapped inside, some of it reabsorbed by the walls and some reflected inside. What happens when we poke a hole in it?

Think of light as emitted and absorbed not as waves but as individual packets, as particles, as discrete clumps. A particle is a thing unto itself that has a particular spatial location; a wave is disturbance in a medium, it is a ripple that requires something to be rippled and is spread out in space. For Einstein, the two are complementary; the particulate nature was the underlying picture, but when you put a bunch of them together traveling through space, they move in a wavelike fashion.

Take ultraviolet light and shine it on a surface, electrons are kicked out. Brighter light should lead to larger wave giving electrons more energy -- but this is not what happens. 

<i>Theory of Relativity</i>

Maxwell's theory: speed of light is constant, but with respect to what?

When we read a clock, we see not what time it is, but what time it was. Light must bounce off theface and hands and travel to observer. We see the time which was at the time light striked the clock. If the observer was moving away from the clock, the light would have to not only get to the the observer but also catch up. Result would be the clock running slow.

Axiom: constancy of speed of light in vacuum for all observers, not matter their state of motion with regard to the source.

Lorentz transformations: how lengths and durations will be measured by different observers and show relationship between them. Lengths contract when measured by observers who are moving with respect to the thing being measured. If you're traveling with speed of light, then size of all things squish to nothing but only in the direction you're traveling. Similarly, faster you travel slower time moves for you. Not only lengths and time, but also differences in mass of the electron. Faster you go, heavier it becomes. At speed of light it becomes infinity heavy, giving it infinite kinetic energy. For this reason, "velocities greater than speed of light have no possibility of existence".

The energy of the body that gives off the light is reduced by an amount that has nothing to do with the composition of the body. If a body gives off the energy L in form of radiation, its mass is diminished by l/C^2, hence, the famous equation, E = mc^2. The mass of the body is a measure of its energy content.
