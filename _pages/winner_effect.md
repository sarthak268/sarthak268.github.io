### The Mystery of Picasso's Son

- Motivation and intrinsic drive are key indicators for sucess
- Intrisinc motivation is the drive to do something for the sense of competence and achievement as opposed to purely extrinsic rewards like money.
- Goldilock's zone of achievements: setting demanding but attainable goals lead to maximum success.
- Hiding the ladder: Parents know they climbed a difficult ladder with many small steps, many of them luck, some perseverence, and some skill and application. But sometimes successful people hide the ladder. In the self-satisfaction of their sucess, they wish to be admirred for their greatness without tarnishing it with the picture of a thousand small steps on a shaky ladder.

### The Puzzle of Changeling Fish

- High testosterone --> traders earn higher profit <-> increase in appetite for risk, likelihood of snatching a daring profit
- Winning -> surge in testosterone <-> less anxious, more aggressive, higher pain threshold -> likely to win next fight
- These surges may be long-term but mostly the brain behaves like a turbo-charged car that pushes more power for the same amount of gasoline
- But all these effects are <i>context-dependent</i> -> context refers to place - sight, sounds, smell. Most of all context means <i>mental landscape</i>, the beliefs, emotions, and feelings - some conscious, most unconscious - that encompass the event.
- Wearing color red results in much more number of wins compared to blue -> wired as danger (due to association with blood), primitive association of dominance -> wearing releases performance enhancing drug - testosterone and reduces it in opponent.
- Negotiations stuck on home-ground always earn better than ones elsewhere.
- Raising clenched fists in triumph -> universal sign of victory and power -> increases confidence in mass action
- Most senior person in a meeting -> strech back, clasp hands behind head, stick out elbows, juniors -> hunch forward over table, head thrust out, hands clasped under the table.
- <b>Key lesson:</b> no matter what I feel outside, if I behave as if the way I want to feel, the feelings will likely follow --> positive feedback loop.
