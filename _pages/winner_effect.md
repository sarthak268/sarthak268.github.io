### The Mystery of Picasso's Son

- Motivation and intrinsic drive are key indicators for sucess
- Intrisinc motivation is the drive to do something for the sense of competence and achievement as opposed to purely extrinsic rewards like money.
- Goldilock's zone of achievements: setting demanding but attainable goals lead to maximum success.
- Hiding the ladder: Parents know they climbed a difficult ladder with many small steps, many of them luck, some perseverence, and some skill and application. But sometimes successful people hide the ladder. In the self-satisfaction of their sucess, they wish to be admirred for their greatness without tarnishing it with the picture of a thousand small steps on a shaky ladder.

### The Puzzle of Changeling Fish

- High testosterone --> traders earn higher profit <-> increase in appetite for risk, likelihood of snatching a daring profit
- Winning -> surge in testosterone <-> less anxious, more aggressive, higher pain threshold -> likely to win next fight
- These surges may be long-term but mostly the brain behaves like a turbo-charged car that pushes more power for the same amount of gasoline
- But all these effects are <i>context-dependent</i> -> context refers to place - sight, sounds, smell. Most of all context means <i>mental landscape</i>, the beliefs, emotions, and feelings - some conscious, most unconscious - that encompass the event.
- Wearing color red results in much more number of wins compared to blue -> wired as danger (due to association with blood), primitive association of dominance -> wearing releases performance enhancing drug - testosterone and reduces it in opponent.
- Negotiations stuck on home-ground always earn better than ones elsewhere.
- Raising clenched fists in triumph -> universal sign of victory and power -> increases confidence in mass action
- Most senior person in a meeting -> strech back, clasp hands behind head, stick out elbows, juniors -> hunch forward over table, head thrust out, hands clasped under the table.
- <i>Key lesson:</i> no matter what I feel outside, if I behave as if the way I want to feel, the feelings will likely follow --> positive feedback loop.

### The Enigma of Bill Clinton's Friend

- Mum effect: 'Shoot the messenger' culture often leads to reluctancy in juniors giving bad news to seniors due to their relatively powerlessness. Hence, most battles are led by upper/middle class rather than lower class.
- Holding power -> egocentricity, corrosion of ability to detach from one's point of view -> (1) less inclined to see event's from other's perspective, (2) subject to illusion that they can control events too vast and complex to be controllable.
- Sex and power are linked to surge in tertosterone -> increase appetute for power and sex -> profound effect on how brain functions.
- Power put blinkers on us -- less likely to be put off by distractors in peripheral vision. Low power brodens the focus of attention to take signals -- warnings.
- Action-man CEO + quitely spoken caution-monger counterpart (accountant / lawyer)
- Noradrenaline: Linked to vigilance, monitoring and response to threat, while dopamine is lined to action towards a goal and reward for achieving it.
- <i>The Need for power:</i> People are motivated to have an impact on other people -- give orders, make decisions, take control --> action-oriented. Actions can also be in the form of giving -- advice, gifts, and direction. Having an impact involves having a particularly strong concern with your own reputation.
- Killer instrinct in sports -- shows need for power --> dominating other
- Signs for need of power: 1) facial expression, 2) sex -- people with more need for power tend to have more intercourse, 3) leaders have less inclination to seek advice or consensus.
- World needs leaders with a desire to make an <i>impact</i> -- power in itself is not a bad thing, problem arises when the brain primed with high need for power is over-exposed to actual power.
- <i>Ideal leader:</i> minimum level of need for power, otherwise responsibilities would be too stressfull.
- Power makes us more ambitious, aggressive, and focused -> opens more doors to gain more power -> power feedback loop
