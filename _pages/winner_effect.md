### The Mystery of Picasso's Son

- Motivation and intrinsic drive are key indicators for sucess
- Intrisinc motivation is the drive to do something for the sense of competence and achievement as opposed to purely extrinsic rewards like money.
- Goldilock's zone of achievements: setting demanding but attainable goals lead to maximum success.
- Hiding the ladder: Parents know they climbed a difficult ladder with many small steps, many of them luck, some perseverence, and some skill and application. But sometimes successful people hide the ladder. In the self-satisfaction of their sucess, they wish to be admirred for their greatness without tarnishing it with the picture of a thousand small steps on a shaky ladder.
