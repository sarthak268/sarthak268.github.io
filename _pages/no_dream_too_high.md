- The sky is not the limit ... there are footprints on the Moon!
- Keep your mind open to possibilities
- Show me your friends and I will show you your future
- Second comes right after first
- Write your own epitaph
- Maintain your spirit of adventure
- Failure is always an option
- Practice respect for all people
- Do what you believe is right even when others choose otherwise
- Trust your gut ... and your instruments
- Laugh ... a lot!
- Keep a young mind-set at every age
- Help others go beyond where you have done

Take it from a man who has walked on the Moon: Be careful what you dream -- it just might come to pass, so be prepared. Apollo is the story of people at their best, working together for a common goal. We started with a dream, and we can do these kinds of things again.

With a united effort and a great team, you too can achieve great things. I know, because I am living proof that no dream is too high!
