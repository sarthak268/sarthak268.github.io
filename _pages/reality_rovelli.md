*Shattering intuitions about space, time, and the nature of reality 🌍*

If in some cataclysm all scientific knowledge were to be destroyed and only one sentence passed on to the next generation of creatures, what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words? I believe it is the atomic hypothesis — all things are made of atoms, little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another.

### Zeno's Paradox

The most famous of Zeno's paradoxes is presented in the form of a brief fable: the tortoise challenge. The tortoise challenges Achilles to a race, starting out with a 10 m advantage. Will Achilles manage to catch up with the tortoise? Zeno argues that rigorous logic dictates that he will never be able to do so. Before catching up, in effect, Achilles needs to cover 10 m, and in order to do this he will take a certain amount of time. During this time the tortoise will still have advanced a few centimeters. To cover these centimeters Achilles will have to take a little more time, but meanwhile the tortoise will have advanced further, and so on to infinity. Achilles therefore requires an infinite number of intervals to reach the tortoise — an infinite number of times.

At the end you will obtain an infinite number of small pieces of string. The sum of these, however, will be finite, because they can only add up to the length of the original piece of string. An infinite number of strings can make a finite string, and an infinite number of increasingly short times may make a finite time. The hero, even if he will have to cover an infinite number of ever-smaller distances, will take a finite time to do so and will end up catching the tortoise.

The solution lies in the idea of the continuum: arbitrarily small times may exist, an infinite number of which make up a finite time.

### Brownian Motion

If we observe attentively very small particles, such as a speck of dust or a grain of pollen suspended in still air or in a liquid, we see them tremble and dance. Pushed by this trembling, they move randomly, zigzagging, and so they drift slowly, gradually moving away from their starting point. This motion of particles in a fluid is called Brownian motion, after a biologist who described it in detail in the 19th century.

There are an enormous number of molecules of air. On average, as many hit the granule from the left as those that hit it from the right. If the air's molecules were infinitely small and infinitely numerous, the effect of collisions from the right and from the left would cancel out at each instant, and the granule would not move. But the finite size of molecules — the fact that they are present in finite rather than infinite number — causes there to be fluctuations. That is to say, the collisions never balance out exactly; they only balance out on average.

### Maxwell's Laws

He computes the speed at which the undulations of Faraday's lines move, and the results turn out to be the same as for light. Why? Maxwell understands: because light is nothing other than this rapid trembling of Faraday's lines!

What is color? Put simply, it is the frequency, or the speed of oscillation, of the electromagnetic wave that light is. If the wave vibrates more rapidly, the light is bluer; if it vibrates a little more slowly, the light is redder.

### The Key Theories

The deepening of our understanding of the world is based on two theories: general relativity and quantum mechanics. Both demand a daring revaluation of our conventional ideas about the world — space and time in relativity, matter and energy in quantum theory.

### Einstein in 1905: Theory of Relativity

Between the past and the future of an event (for example, between the past and the future of you, where you are, and the moment in which you are reading), there exists an intermediate zone, an expanded present — a zone that is neither past nor future. The duration of this intermediate zone, which is neither in your past nor in your future, is very small and depends on where an event takes place relative to you. The greater the distance of the event from you, the longer the duration of the extended present.

On the Moon, the duration of the expanded present is a few seconds, and on Mars it is a quarter of an hour. This means we can say that on Mars there are events that at this precise moment have already happened, events that are yet to happen, but also a quarter of an hour during which things occur that are neither in our past nor in our future.

In technical terms, we say that Einstein had understood that "absolute simultaneity" does not exist: there is no collection of events in the universe which exists "now."

Spacetime: the set of all past and future events, but also those that are neither past nor future; these do not form a single instant — they have themselves a duration.

In the Andromeda galaxy, the duration of this expanded present is 2 million years. Everything that happens during these two million years is neither past nor future with respect to ourselves.

A result of this restructuring is that, as space and time fuse together in a single concept of spacetime, so the electric field and the magnetic field fuse together in the same way, merging into a single entity which today we call the electromagnetic field.

The concepts of mass and energy become combined in the same way as time and space, and electric and magnetic fields, are fused together in the new mechanics.

This implies that mass by itself is not conserved, and energy as it was understood at the time is not independently conserved either. One may be transformed into the other: only one single law of conservation exists, not two. What is conserved is the sum of mass and energy, not each separately. Processes must exist that transform energy into mass or mass into energy. The result is the celebrated formula E = mc².

The present is like the flatness of the Earth: an illusion. We imagine a flat Earth because of the limitations of our senses, because we cannot see much beyond our noses. Had our brain and our senses been more precise, had we easily perceived time in nanoseconds, we would never have made up the idea of a present extending everywhere. We would have easily recognized the intermediate zone between our past and future. We would have realized that saying "here and now" makes sense, but that saying "now" to designate events happening throughout the universe makes no sense.

### Einstein in 1915

The world is not made of space + particles + electromagnetic field + gravitational field. The world is made up of particles + fields, and nothing else. There is no need to add space as an extra ingredient. Newton's space is the gravitational field. Or vice versa, which amounts to saying the same thing: the gravitational field is space.

The Sun bends space around itself, and the Earth does not circle around it drawn by a mysterious distant force, but runs straight in a space that inclines. It is like a bead which rolls in a funnel: there are no mysterious forces generated by the center of the funnel; it is the curved nature of the funnel wall which guides the rotation of the bead. Planets revolve and things fall because space around them is curved.

Riemann's result was that the properties of a curved space in any dimension are described by a particular mathematical object which we now call Riemann curvature and indicate with the letter R. In a landscape of plains, hills, and mountains, the curvature R of the surface is zero on plains, which are flat — that is, without curvature — and different from zero where there are valleys and hills. It is maximum where there are pointed peaks of mountains, that is to say, where the ground is least flat or most curved. Riemann's math: an equation where R is proportional to the energy of matter. In other words, spacetime curves more where there is matter.

But it is not only space that curves; time does too. Einstein predicts that time on Earth passes more quickly at higher altitude and more slowly at lower altitude. Place a watch on the floor and another on a table: the one on the floor registers less passing of time than the one on the table. Why? Because time is not universal and fixed; it is something which expands and shrinks according to the vicinity of masses. The Earth, like all masses, distorts spacetime, slowing time down in its vicinity.

There are two absurd entities: the absurdity of an infinite space and the absurdity of a universe with a fixed border, and there did not seem to be any reasonable choice between them. But Einstein finds that the universe can be finite and at the same time have no boundary. How? Just as the surface of the Earth is finite but does not have a boundary — there is nowhere it ends. This can happen naturally enough if something like the surface of the Earth is curved. And in the theory of general relativity, of course, three-dimensional space can also be curved. Consequently, our universe can be finite but borderless.

The leap made by Einstein is unparalleled: spacetime is a field; the world is made up of only fields and particles; space and time are not something else, something different from the rest of nature — they are just a field among others.
