### The Inflection Point

- Russia's early lead: Sputnik 1 - world's first artificial satellite, Yuri Gagarin - first human in space
- US takes over -- 1969 Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin plant US flag on the Moon, bursts terrestial bonds and began exploration of space, no visible limits to man's future in the universe
- NASA's budget cuts -- from a peak of 4.4% of the federal budget to averaging 0.5% in the past decade
- Two proposals: Space Transportation System, a space shuttle, and ISS -- both coupled in the sense that one cannot exist without the other -- soon falls through because of inaccurate estimates, bureaucracy, and eventually extremely high cost of getting in space (~$1B)
- Bush in 2004, promotes private companies to enter the sector, design vehicles capable of bringing cargo to ISS, deliver cargo
- <i>COTS Program:</i> 1) traditional cost-plus --> fixed cost model promoting cost efficiency; 2) oversight --> insight by NASA; 3) NASA became one customer among many, allowing companies to keep IP for their tech

### Blue Origin

- Motivation: solar system can support trillions of humans and if we had trillion humans we would have a thousand Einsteins and a thousand Mozarts, space alone held promise of unlimited resources and energy, thus unlimited potential for humanity
- Criticised for not participating in NASA proposals (vs SpaceX) because of long-term thinking and Bezos' funding resources (he was a billionaire when he started)
- Acted more as a philanthopic nonprofit rather than a startup --> soon realized mistakes 

### SpaceX

- Driven cost of launching down by 90%; $62M per launch or $2800 per kg ~ 5% of what it cost the shuttle --> launching is the first step to building anything in space
- Proven market-oriented approach to space can work; most valuable private company
- Musk realized we needed a Moore's law in space: cost per pound to space is constantly decreasing
- Ideology: <b>Failure</b> is an option here. Learn from failure, improve the prototype and test it again
