# Bio

I am a graduate student at [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/), [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). I am working at [Advanced Agents - Robotics Technology Lab](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/robotics-groups/advanced-agent-robotics-technology-lab/) advised by of [Dr. Katia Sycara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katia_Sycara). 
Currently, I am working on the following problems: (1) learning of visual (objects and scenes) and abstract (affordances and attributes) concepts using domain knowledge priors, (2) knowledge-guided short-context action anticipation from human-centric videos, (3) grasping of novel objects using vision-language models, (4) diffusion model-based action anticipation from videos, (5) offline reinforcement learning approach that encodes agent's intentions.

Most recently, I worked as a Deep Learning Engineer at [Preimage](https://preimage.ai/), where I worked on problems involving 3D vision for drone-based photogrammetry.

Previously, I worked as a Visiting Researcher at [Cognitive Learning and Vision for Robotics (CLVR) Lab](https://www.clvrai.com/), [University of Southern California (USC), USA](https://www.usc.edu/) under the guidance of [Dr. Joseph Lim](https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~limjj/). I majorly focused on problems involving adaptation of policies to novel unseen environments and continual learning of skills.

During my short stint as a Research Assistant at the [Deep Cognition and Language Research Lab](https://declare-lab.net/index), [Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/), advised by [Dr. Soujanya Poria](https://sporia.info/index), I worked on zero-shot visual classification and vision & language applications. 

I completed my B.Tech (with Honors) in ECE from [IIIT-Delhi](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/). In my Bachelor's Thesis under [Dr. Saket Anand](http://faculty.iiitd.ac.in/~anands/) in collaboration with [Dr. Pavan Turaga, Geometric Media Lab](https://pavanturaga.com/) (Arizona State Univesity, USA) at the [Infosys Center of Artificial Intelligence](https://cai.iiitd.ac.in/). Here, I worked on unsupervised representation learning for disentangling multiple factors of variation in images.  You can find my Bachelor's thesis [here](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sarthak-Bhagat/publication/346983991_Geometry_of_Neural_Network_based_Disentangled_Latent_Space_Models/links/5fd74b4445851553a0b59699/Geometry-of-Neural-Network-based-Disentangled-Latent-Space-Models.pdf).

Previously, I worked as an intern at the [SUTD Brain Lab](https://sutdbrain.wordpress.com/about/) under [Dr. Nengli Lim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nengli-lim-48a22b14/?originalSubdomain=sg) on the disentanglement of video sequences using Gaussian processes. I have also worked at [Collaborative Robotics Lab (CORAL)](http://robotics.iiitd.edu.in/coral/?page_id=20) and [Multi-robot Autonomy (MOON) Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/m00nlab/home?authuser=0) under [Dr. P.B. Sujit](https://eecs.iiserb.ac.in/faculty_profile.php?id=OQ==&lname=c3VqaXQ=) on target tracking using deep reinforcement learning.

I am mainly interested in representation learning for visual data, computer vision for robotics, and robot learning.
